Code for EE118 final project for Laura Waller's class at the University of California Berkeley.
With a special thanks to Shwetadwip Chowdhury and David Ren of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at UC Berkeley.
The code is made to transform an image from a Michelson Interferometer to fourier space, and then return a nice phase image.
To use this code, please download the mainqual folder. You will need to change the path of the mainqual algorithm to the location of this folder.
